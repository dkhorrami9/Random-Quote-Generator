## How to get the program if you have no clue what git is and can't even write code

### Install Latest Version of Python
Go to [Python's download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download the latest version of Python.

### Download the zip file on GitHub
Press the green <u>__Code__</u> then click "Download ZIP" to download a zip file containing the code and this README file.

### Unzip the zip File
Find where the zip file is located and unzip it so you can see and interact with all the contents in the file.

### Run Program
Once you have installed the latest version of Python, a program called IDLE should be installed. Locate the unzipped file and open the __main.py__ file with IDLE. In IDLE you will see all the code there and there will be a __Run__ button at the top of the application or computer screen depending on the orientation and operating system. Click the Run button and then click Run Module to finally use the program.

### Updates
If any updates happen to the program, you will need to reinstall the code every time and keep the same database on your computer if you choose this method of installing.
